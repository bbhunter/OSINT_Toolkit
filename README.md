# OSINT_Toolkit
A rudimentary collection of handmade OSINT tools to help me do recon for bug bounties.

# Objective

Tools to scan these commonly used platforms to try to assist in recon for bug bounties. I am hoping that by building this application, I will not only have a cool automated tool to use, but I can also get some practice coding with Python and integrating APIs. **For the love of God please don't use this to be a creep**

I hope to be able to implement basic tools for the following web applications:
### Twitter
- Common contacts (to lead to more OSINT targets at the same company)
- Common words?
- Timezone?
- Hashtags
### Facebook
- Network analysis
    Starting point: https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/social-network-analysis-python
- Common words?
### Reddit
- List of subreddits (looking for tech-related subreddits: maybe they asked a question that could give a clue to vulns?)
### LinkedIn
- List of employees and use certain keywords for parameters of positions / people to look for.
### Github
- Look for open repos.
### Trello
- Google dorks to look for potentially exposed passwords.

# Methodology:
1) search company
2) search potential individuals.
